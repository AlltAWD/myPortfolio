# Welcome!

This is my first blog post with **Markdown** and LaTeX support!

## Math Example

Here's a mathematical formula:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

And an inline equation: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

## Code Example

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

## Another Section

You can write all sorts of content here:

- Bullet points
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- `inline code`

> This is a blockquote

Thanks for reading!
